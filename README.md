# FizzBuzz-Project

FizzBuzz is a well known programming assignment, asked during interviews.

FizzBuzz is a game that has gained in popularity as a programming assignment to weed out non-programmers during job interviews. The objective of the assignment is less about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more about showing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as if-/else-statements and loops.

The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:

- It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n. 
- For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
- For each multiple of 5, prints "Buzz" instead of the number. 
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz". 
- Else, print the number.
